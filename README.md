# 🎮 Java Games Portfolio

This repository represents my personal collection of **Java desktop games**, created to practice and demonstrate **object-oriented programming**, GUI development, and game logic design.

The portfolio will grow over time as I continue to build new games and experiment with different mechanics, architectures, and AI behaviors.
